# ImmuNetNAS


ImmuNetNAS is a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method which inspired by the immune network theory.

The core of ImmuNetNAS is built on the original immune network algorithm, which iteratively updates the population through hypermutation
and selection, and eliminates the self-generation individuals that do not meet the requirements through comparing antibody affinity and interspecific similarity.


This is version 3.0, we will keep updating the code and adding functions.
